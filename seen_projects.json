    "description": "AWS Data Lake Sprint \u2013 Statement of Work\nProject Overview\nClient: Broadband Company\nLocation: New England-based operations; Boston-area consultants preferred but not required\nEngagement Type: Contract consultant, immediate availability required\nBudget: $200\u2013$250/hour\nDuration: 4-6 weeks, with potential for extension\nStart Date: Immediately (February 2026)\nBusiness Context\nThis Broadband Company operates a network portfolio serving commercial and residential customers across fiber, copper, and contracted operations. The business is in the midst of critical strategic decisions requiring immediate access to reliable unit economics, customer profitability analysis, and operational intelligence.\nAn AWS data lake project was initiated to centralize and analyze financial, billing, and customer data from multiple legacy systems (BillingSystemA billing, CRMSysB, AcctSysC accounting, Vendor circuit inventory, NetworkSysE network planning, HRSysD, FutureSysG future billing). The project has made substantial technical progress but has stalled due to:\nUnderestimated data quality issues in legacy systems\nScope expansion as business needs became clearer\nInternal resource constraints \u2013 staff pulled to operational firefighting\nTimeline slippage \u2013 deadlines have repeatedly moved due to the above and complexity\nThe infrastructure is largely in place: S3 buckets configured, Glue catalogs created, Athena queries functional, raw and curated data layers partially populated, and a PrototypeUIF prototype UI built. What's needed is a senior AWS and AI data/analytics consultant to help push the project across the finish line by validating data, completing integrations, training the AI layer, and delivering a production-ready dashboard with accurate, complete data.\nCurrent State Assessment: What's Built and Working\nInfrastructure (Complete):\nAWS S3 data lake (raw and curated buckets in us-east-2)\nAWS Glue data catalog with crawlers\nAmazon Athena for SQL queries\nPrototypeUIF prototype UI with natural language query interface\nIAM roles, encryption (server-side), CloudWatch/CloudTrail logging (basic)\nData Ingestion (Partially Complete):\nBillingSystemA (billing): Test exports loaded, schema mapped, invoice line-item reproduction views (v1) working, nightly exports designed but blocked by DNS configuration\nCRMSysB: Full org export completed (Accounts, Contracts, Opportunities), not yet landed in S3/Athena, attachments/files export pending\nAcctSysC: Trial balance and AP/AR aging reports pulled, partial ingestion (vendor/customer/AP healthy; GL ENTRY failing)\nVendor Circuit Inventory: Spreadsheet data loaded, margin band views (A-E classification) complete, fully-loaded margin model v1.1 in progress\nNetworkSysE: FSA (fiber service area) polygons loaded, premise/BSL-level features NOT landed\nCurated Views (Partially Complete):\nCustomer dimension table (dimcustomerBillingSystemA) \u2013 thousands of unique customers identified\nMonthly MRR/churn summary (vmonthlymrrandchurnsummary) \u2013 working for FY2025\nVendor margin bands (A-E) \u2013 complete v1, three action shortlists created\nHosted PBX migration economics \u2013 complete v1\nInvoice line-item reproduction \u2013 complete for 3-month window\nSystem segmentation (Network A vs Network B vs Network C) \u2013 partially wired\n3-bucket customer classification (Customer Type) \u2013 logic defined, wiring in progress\nDashboard (Prototype in PrototypeUIF):\nNatural language query interface (text-to-SQL via AWS AI Layer)\nTiles for MRR, active customers, churn, A-E margin bands, Hosted PBX uplift\nEvidence panels showing SQL queries and Athena execution IDs\nCSV export functionality\nSome tiles reconciled; others still need validation\nWhat's Incomplete or Blocked\nCritical Blockers (as of January 29, 2026):\nCRMSysB-BillingSystemA crosswalk table not populated \u2192 Customer Type bucket split cannot map system-effective IDs to human-readable keys like \"LOCATION 1\" or \"LOCATION 2\"\nAcctSysC December 2025 GL Detail not landed \u2192 Existing GL data (Oct 2025) mis-shaped (col1..col10 format unusable for EBITDA calculations)\nNetworkSysE premise/BSL feature export not landed \u2192 Premises-passed/served KPIs cannot be lake-backed; BSL counts per system unavailable\nBillingSystemA SQL nightly export connectivity issue \u2192 Worker cannot resolve hostname due to DNS misconfiguration (no upstream resolver, no sudo access to fix /etc/resolv.conf); workaround is to use DB IP directly or fix DNS search domain\nAcctSysC GL ENTRY ingestion failing \u2192 Daily ingest healthy for vendors/customers/AP but GL ENTRY returns \"status=failure, processing error\"; workaround is querying historical partitions\nSecurity hardening incomplete \u2192 IAM roles slightly over-granted (intentional for dev speed), no formal least-privilege roles defined for CEO/finance/sales, no dedicated KMS CMK with tagging standards, no formal security review/sign-off\nContract PDFs not centralized \u2192 CRMSysB attachment exports not completed; contract PDFs not gathered into shared location; prevents \"Customer 360\" contract term analysis\nData quality validation incomplete \u2192 Known disputes in certain circuit data (flagged by operations lead), orphan costs/revenues (circuits/accounts that don't cleanly map between BillingSystemA/circuit/CRMSysB), COGS accuracy not signed off as audit-ready\nFunctional Gaps:\nPeriod toggles (Current/YTD/Monthly) in dashboard only partially functional \u2013 monthly-capable views exist, but current-only views don't support time-series yet\nAI layer (Amazon Bedrock + Q Business) designed but not implemented \u2013 natural language interface prototype uses PrototypeUIF, not production AWS stack\nAutomated nightly refresh \u2013 designed but not fully operational due to BillingSystemA SQL connectivity blocker\nGL Close Pack tile \u2013 month-aware revenue close views defined but not wired to dashboard\nMovement/churn views by segment and system/project \u2013 partially built, not reconciled to core MRR spine\nFully-loaded margin (COGS + OPEX allocation) \u2013 COGS v1 complete, OPEX allocation method not finalized, AcctSysC GL wiring incomplete\nExecutive P&L by bucket/segment \u2013 designed but not delivered (requires complete OPEX + margin views)\nProjects pipeline module in Dashboard \u2013 schema defined, S3 change-file pattern designed, ETL not implemented\nFutureSysG migration prep \u2013 customer/product tagging in progress, lake export contracts not finalized\nScope of Work \u2013 Deliverables\nThe consultant will complete the following in priority order:\nPhase 1: Critical Path to Production (Week 1-2)\n1.1 Resolve Technical Blockers\nFix BillingSystemA SQL nightly export connectivity (coordinate with IT to resolve DNS or configure DB IP workaround)\nResolve AcctSysC GL ENTRY ingestion failure (debug Lambda/Glue error, implement fix or workaround)\nPopulate CRMSysB-BillingSystemA crosswalk table (curatedcore.sfsystemscrosswalk) to enable bucket mapping\nLand CRMSysB Accounts/Contracts/Opportunities CSVs in S3/Athena (already extracted, need loading)\nLand AcctSysC December 2025 GL Detail in correct schema (replace mis-shaped Oct 2025 data)\nCoordinate NetworkSysE premise/BSL feature export and land in lake (work with NetworkSysE vendor/internal GIS contact)\n1.2 Complete Core Curated Views\nFinalize 3-bucket customer classification (Owned FTTP / Contracted FTTP / CLEC Business) with system-to-bucket mapping fully wired\nComplete monthly MRR movement/churn views by segment and system/project, reconciled to core MRR
